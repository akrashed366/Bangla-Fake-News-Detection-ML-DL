📰 Fake News Detection in Bangla  
### MSc Engineering Project | Machine Learning & Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting fake news in **Bangla (Bengali)** using both **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** techniques. The goal is to build intelligent systems that can classify Bangla news content as real or fake, helping to mitigate misinformation and preserve public trust.

## 🎯 Objective
To design, train, and evaluate classification models capable of detecting fake news articles written in the Bangla language using NLP, ML, and DL algorithms.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, etc.)
- TensorFlow / Keras (LSTM, CNN, RNN)
- Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF, Word Embedding)
- Bangla NLP preprocessing libraries
- Google Colab / Jupyter
- Dataset collected from Bangla news portals

## 🧠 Algorithms Applied
- 🔹 **Machine Learning**: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest  
- 🔹 **Deep Learning**: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC Curve

## 🗃️ Dataset
The dataset includes both real and fake Bangla news articles, manually collected and pre-processed for training/testing. [Add more details or link to dataset if it's public]
